You have to explain the rationale behind an explanation generated by an XAI model to lay users, who are not necessarily technically inclined. I will give you the explanation for why the model determined a specific job ([JOB]) to be a good match for a candidate (Chris de Vries). The explanation is based on a graph structure, which contains the following nodes and edges:

--- LINKS ---

The edge values indicate how important the XAI model found the edge to be for the explanation. Base your explanation on the path(s) from the target user to the target job in their entirety. Please make sure to be as clear and accessible as possible. Do not refer to individual values or edges; instead, focus on full paths between the target user and job. Try to refrain from using graph-related words. I.e., explain it like how a more experienced person would explain it to someone who is quite new to the topic.

Your explanation should be in Dutch, and be a full text in completed sentences. Do not use bullet points or anything of the sorts. Be concrete and straight to the point, but not too direct. Do not use hypotheticals or imagination or analogies. Simply give an explanation on why the match is likely to be good. Format in HTML using <p> tags.
