# Code used for the paper Creating Healthy Friction: Determining Stakeholder Requirements of Job Recommendation Explanations

By Roan Schellingerhout, Francesco Barile, and Nava Tintarev.


The hyperparameters used in the paper were: 

    - text embedding size = 32; 
    - node embedding size = 64;
    - graph embedding size = 32;
    - attention heads = 3;
    - Bases for conversion to heterogeneous graph = 3. 

This gave a normalized discounted cumulative gain of 0.606 on the test set, compared to a score of 0.511 achieved by the baseline model.
